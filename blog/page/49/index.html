  <div class="entry-content">Vish Viswanathan is conducting his famous TOGAF training course in Sydney and Melbourne in the month of September. I have attended his course in Sydney and I can confidently say that Vish is one of the finest trainers I have met. The best part of his course is the interaction among attendees. After the course I left with a much better understanding of Enterprise Architecture.

So if you are looking to get TOGAF certification or you are working in an environment where TOGAF is used or will be used then this course is worth the buck.

You can find more details about the course and fees <a href="http://www.ccandcsolutions.com/">here</a>.

  <div class="entry-content">In this post I will show you how to perform dynamic sorting with LINQ. I will work with a simple collection of City class. City class is defined below.

<code lang="csharp">
public class City
{
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public string Country { get; set; }
}
</code>

The collection is initialised using this code

<code lang="csharp">
List<City> cities = new List<City>
  {
    new City{ Name = "Sydney", Country = "Australia" },
    new City{ Name = "New York", Country = "USA" },
    new City{ Name = "Paris", Country = "France" },
    new City{ Name = "Milan", Country = "Spain" },
    new City{ Name = "Melbourne", Country = "Australia" },
    new City{ Name = "Auckland", Country = "New Zealand" },
    new City{ Name = "Tokyo", Country = "Japan" },
    new City{ Name = "New Delhi", Country = "India" },
    new City{ Name = "Hobart", Country = "Australia" }
  };
</code>

A typical example of applying a sort will be to write such a query.

<code lang="csharp">
var collection =
  from c in cities
  orderby c.Country
  select c;
</code>
Here we are sorting the collection on country. Note that this is static in nature.

Code above as you can see can only sort by country. If I wanted to sort by city name then I&#8217;d be writing another query and maybe use a conditional construct such as if or switch and write a method which takes in a parameter. While this will work, it is not the best way to do it.

LINQ gives us the ability to make our code dynamic. I can provide sort functionality for my query by writing a method which takes in a Func&lt;TElement, TKey&gt; delegate. This delegate is used by the OrderBy extension method. This is how I can write my method.

<code lang="csharp">
public static void Sort<TKey>(List<City> cities, Func<City, TKey> selector)
{
  var sortedCollection =
    from c in cities
    orderby selector(c)
    select c;

  foreach (var item in sortedCollection)
  {
    Console.WriteLine(item.Name);
  }
}
</code>

This method can be called like this by passing in the cities collection which has been initialised earlier.

<code lang="csharp">
Sort(cities, c => c.Name);
</code>

I can also sort by country without changing my query. To sort by country I just need to call my sort method like this.

<code lang="csharp">
Sort(cities, c => c.Country);
</code>

LINQ is very powerful when you start using it on daily bases. It would not be very useful if everything was static. In this post I showed you how you can make your sorting code dynamic. Stay tuned for more LINQ goodness.

  <div class="entry-content">Before a certification exam goes live it is released as beta. Beta exams are by invite only and there are limited number of places. These exams also run for a short period of time. Till now finding about beta exams has been a bit of a trick. Your best bets are forums or various blogs. However this is changing. There is a new blog called <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/betaexams/">Beta Exam Announcements</a> where you can find out about upcoming beta exams.

If you are interested in finding about beta exams then subscribe to the <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/betaexams/rss.xml">feed</a> of <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/betaexams/">Beta Exam Announcements</a>.

  <div class="entry-content">It is clear that when it comes to Web, Microsoft is not the leading player. That batch goes to a startup(when compared to Microsoft) named Google. At times I feel that in the process of introducing new products Microsoft at times forgets about their old products which could be widely in use. For example Hotmail. It looks like Microsoft has totally forgotten about Hotmail which was once their crown jewel.

Why have they slipped? I think because they have stopped paying attention to small things. Here is an example: After reading an email on Hotmail if you wish to delete it then you must scroll all the way up to top to find the delete button. How hard can it be to put a delete button and maybe the entire toolbar at the end of each message? And while logging in why do users have to type in &lt;xyz&gt;@hotmail.com. It isn&#8217;t like any other domain names can be used.

<a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0B6PDO8HPEQZNZWpTRms0ZWtlaUU/uploads/2008/08/image.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B6PDO8HPEQZNZWpTRms0ZWtlaUU/uploads/2008/08/image-thumb.png" border="0" alt="hotmail" width="467" height="37" /></a>

As a user I am looking for simple ways to achieve my goals. Web based Hotmail isn&#8217;t just cutting it anymore. It really should not be a surprise if millions of people have moved to GMail. Ray Ozzie in his Internet Services Disruption memo said
<blockquote>But for all our great progress, our efforts have not always led to the degree that perhaps they could have. We should&#8217;ve been leaders with all our web properties in harnessing the potential of AJAX, following our pioneering work in OWA.</blockquote>
My 2 cents to Microsoft is that maybe you have stopped looking for simple solutions. How about getting your users involved in improving Hotmail. Ask them what they want and I am sure you will get valuable feedback. While Microsoft has done a great job in giving users previews of their software through beta and CTP programs, such an effort is lacking in web based products. So if this post is ever read by anyone who has anything to do with Hotmail or other Microsoft web based products, my suggestion is to have conversations with your users. And have a conversation without noise. Announcing a product after product is great but pause and ask your users what they think about those products.

  <div class="entry-content">Few weeks ago Microsoft announced a new certification called <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/master/default.mspx">Microsoft Certified Master</a>. In an ever growing cluster of Microsoft certification this one allows you to specialise in a particular technology area. So what does this mean? Aren&#8217;t other certifications specialising as well? According to Microsoft, Master certification is intended towards candidates who spend most of their time working with one product. This is different than your average developer who needs to know about many technologies such as ASP.NET, SQL Server, WCF, WFP etc.
<h4>Master Tracks</h4>
At present Microsoft has announced Master certifications for Windows Server 2008, Exchange Server 2007 and SQL Server 2008. Other Master certifications in pipeline are for SharePoint Server 2007 and Office Communications Server 2007.
<h4>How do I get one?</h4>
The process to achieve the master status includes a three week training course in Redmond. You then have to write three written exams and in addition you must clear one lab exam.
<h4>When can I enrol?</h4>
Registration process is expected to start within one month.
<h4>How much does it cost?</h4>
Now this is a big one. The cost of Master Certification is $18,500 USD. This straight away puts it off radar for a majority of population. But if you break it up then you are paying approximately $6000 per week to be trained by some of the best brains in the world. On weekly based this is not much more than what you would pay for a specialising technology course.
<h4>How do I prepare?</h4>
This is not the kind of certification where you an buy a book and read it page-to-page and then work all the examples out and you are ready for exam. In my opinion, you will walk into the course being an expert++ and you will be polished and given more knowledge than mere mortals in the training course.
<h4>What do people think?</h4>
From what I can observe after talking to friends, colleagues and by reading blogs that Master Certification is receiving mixed signals. After not so jubilant reception of Microsoft Certified Architect many people are questioning the benefits of Master Certification. But this is yet to be verified.

You can read more about Microsoft Master Certification and community&#8217;s opinions <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/trika/archive/2008/06/26/more-on-the-certified-master-programs-from-me-per-the-program-owner.aspx">here</a>.
