  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a programmer I love my enums. I find code written using enums to be more readable than without them. However, there has been and there still is a disconnect between lookup tables in a database and enums in code. One has to restore to some creative trickery to get them working in harmony. Recently while working on a project which involves using LINQ To SQL, I came up with a process which gives me the best of both worlds i.e. using lookup tables in database and enums in code. I am documenting my solution here. Hopefully it will help you.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <h4>The problem</h4>  <p>In my database I have two tables. To make things simple I will call them Customer and CustomerStatus. Customer table stores information about a customer and CustomerStatus table is a lookup table which will store values such as &quot;Active&quot; and &quot;Inactive&quot;.</p>  <p><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="146" alt="image" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B6PDO8HPEQZNZWpTRms0ZWtlaUU/uploads/2008/11/image6.png" width="459" border="0" /> </p>  <p>For CustomerStatus I would like to use an enum in code. This can be done using the designer as explained <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/robp/archive/2008/05/19/using-c-enumerations-as-linq-to-sql-entity-properties.aspx">here</a>. But I would like to use SqlMetal to automate code generation. SqlMetal does not have any options which can be used to solve my problem.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <h4>My Solution</h4>  <p>My solution is to generate dbml file using SqlMetal, then run a custom process which modifies dbml to make it enum ready and finally generate code using SqlMetal looking over dbml file.</p>  <p><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="281" alt="image" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B6PDO8HPEQZNZWpTRms0ZWtlaUU/uploads/2008/11/image7.png" width="261" border="0" /> </p>  <h5>Step 1</h5>  <p>Step 1 is to generate a dbml file from database using SQLMetal with a statement like this:</p>  <p><font color="#000080">SqlMetal /server:. /database:CustomerDb /dbml:CustomerDb.dbml /namespace:CustomerApp</font></p>  <p>In the dbml file I look at the column element generated for CustomerStatusID in Customer Table node. I find that it&#8217;s Type is set to System.Int32</p>  <p><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="68" alt="image" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B6PDO8HPEQZNZWpTRms0ZWtlaUU/uploads/2008/11/image8.png" width="292" border="0" /> </p>  <h5>Step 2</h5>  <p>Step 2 involves writing a process which could just be a simple console application. This process looks for usage of lookup table&#8217;s Id colum in main table and replaces the value of Type attribute with corresponding enum. I am following a naming convention so that my enums are all suffixed with Enum and in database the foreign key field on my main table is named &lt;lookup table name&gt; + Id.</p>  <p><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="67" alt="image" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B6PDO8HPEQZNZWpTRms0ZWtlaUU/uploads/2008/11/image9.png" width="278" border="0" /> </p>  <h5>Step 3 </h5>  <p>Generate code with SqlMetal. Use the option which works with a dbml file. Here is a sample statement:</p>  <p><font color="#000080">SqlMetal /code:Customer.cs /map:CustomerDb.map CustomerDb.dbml</font></p>  <div>&#160;</div>  <div>Generated code now uses the enum for CustomerStatusId property rather than System.Int32</div>  <div>&#160;</div>  <div><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="370" alt="image" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B6PDO8HPEQZNZWpTRms0ZWtlaUU/uploads/2008/11/image10.png" width="359" border="0" /> </div>  <h5>Step 4</h5>  <p>A batch file can be created to tie this all up. Batch file will do the following things:</p>  <ol>   <li>Run SqlMetal to generate dbml file </li>    <li>Run the process which modifies dbml file as mentioned in step 2 </li>    <li>Generate code using SqlMetal from dbml file </li> </ol>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Doing this allows me to work with enums in my code and at the same use lookup tables in database. As an addition a simple process can also be written which can populate lookup tables with the values from enums.</p>  <p>&#160;</p> <a href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/kick/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.thereforesystems.com%2fenum-support-with-linq-to-sql-and-sqlmetal%2f"><img alt="kick it on DotNetKicks.com" src="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/Services/Images/KickItImageGenerator.ashx?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.thereforesystems.com%2fenum-support-with-linq-to-sql-and-sqlmetal%2f" border="0" /></a>

  <div class="entry-content"><h4>Where are we today?</h4>
Since its inception as Avalon I have dedicated countless hours to the technology we now know as WPF. I can probably say that I am one of the few people who have worked on WPF at a commercial level at least in Australia. This is because the number of projects using WPF have been scarce. And I was fortunate to get involved because of my community work around WPF.

I have also tried to convince clients to go with WPF as the preferred choice over Windows Forms. I will admit that I have not been very successful in doing this. The main reason I believe is that WPF has suffered with lack of confidence. While the push has been there from Microsoft, somehow it has not come across very well. We all know about demos about spinning text boxes and playing videos in buttons. These I must say have not conveyed the benefits of WPF to business gracefully. Even though Microsoft has used WPF for their Expression products, it just has not been enough.
<h4>Do I see things changing?</h4>
You bet! With Microsoft writing Visual Studio 2010 shell using WPF, it will change the opinions about this technology in minds of many. Visual Studio is an integral part of any dev shop running Microsoft Platform. And when the flagship product which is bread and butter of millions of developers uses WPF it delivers a confident statement. Microsoft by using WPF for development of Visual Studio will communicate the benefits of data visualization better than any number of presentations. When you will work with Visual Studio 2010 I am sure the conversation will be something like this. Hey! Look at that Architecture Explorer. I really like the way it lays out all those diagrams. Did you know that the entire shell is written in WPF?
<h4>What else can Microsoft do?</h4>
Visual Studio 2010 launch will be a defining point for WPF&#8217;s future. Microsoft should produce white papers, guidance documents and start conversation around how they used WPF for development of Visual Studio. I have always felt that a successful path to WPF is through interop with Windows Forms. Somehow that balance has been missing or the message has not been sent out properly. I cannot imagine Visual Studio 2010 to be without significant interop between WPF and Windows Forms. This is also a golden opportunity for Microsoft to talk about their journey on the interop path. How decisions were made, when and how did they engage designers, did the collaboration between designers and developers work well? Microsoft should start talking about these topics.
<h4>Finally</h4>
Seize the moment by which I mean the beta cycle for Visual Studio 2010. This is the time for WPF to shine. For a glimpse of Visual Studio 2010 here is screenshot from <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tims/archive/2008/11/03/wpf-developers-pdc-wrap-up-and-visual-studio-tooling-update.aspx">Tim&#8217;s blog</a>.

  <div class="entry-content">As a part of my job I often travel around Sydney so I use a <a href="http://www.vodafone.com.au">Vodafone mobile Internet</a> connection to keep myself connected. At home I connect to my wireless network. Recently I faced a problem with my <a href="http://www.hardwarezone.com.au/reviews/view.php?cid=14&amp;id=2700">new laptop</a>. The issue was that I could not connect to wireless network at home. After many attempts to repair, renew my IP address and apply other tricks I decided to uninstall Vodafone software. After uninstalling Vodafone software I could connect to Wi-Fi. But I need to connect to mobile internet when I am on road. Thankfully I found the solution to my problem
<h4>Solution</h4>
Ditch the Vodafone software and start using <a href="http://www.nerve.org.za/mdma/">MDMA (Mobile Data Monitoring Application)</a>. MDMA does not require you to install anything and works without any problems. I can now connect to mobile Internet and to Wi-Fi without any fuss.

<a href="http://www.nerve.org.za/mdma/">MDMA</a> is also very light weight and has a small memory footprint.

You can <a href="http://www.nerve.org.za/mdma/">download MDMA here</a>.

  <div class="entry-content">I am running a LINQ To SQL Training day on Saturday November 8th at Microsoft Office in North Ryde. The course is <strong>FREE</strong> for anyone to attend but there are <strong>only 20 places</strong> available. So if have not yet jumped into the wonderful world of writing LINQ queries. If you are considering LINQ To SQL for your project. If you think that you need a head start on LINQ To SQL. Then attend this one day course and give yourself a LINQ To SQL confidence boost.

You can register for this course by contacting <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/acoat/archive/2008/10/29/free-linq-to-sql-training-in-sydney-nov-8th.aspx">Andrew Coates</a> through this <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/acoat/contact.aspx">link</a>.

There will be computers available in the training room. You are also welcome to bring your own laptops and that way you can take the code you write during training with you. If you plan to bring your own laptop then make sure that you have Visual Studio 2008 and SQL Server 2005/2008 installed.

The error would occur when I created a new folder on the card. Initially I suspected this to be a virus but I also wanted to explore other options. And I discovered the solution pretty much by accident.
<h5>Solution</h5>
I had many files in the root of SD Card. <strong>Moving files from root to another folder fixed the error</strong> and I can now create new folders and copy new files.

So if you have too many files in the root and cannot create new folders or copy new files then check if you have a little too many files in the root. If yes, then move these files to another folder on your SD card.
