<p>  <p>Few days ago I finished reading Programming Entity Framework Second Edition by Julia Lerman. This is a review of the book.</p>  <p>Julia has written a book which targets a broad spectrum of EF expertise. If you are a beginner then this book is for you to learn Entity Framework. If you are an expert then this book is for you to learn advance Entity Framework concepts. Her writing style is seldom found in technical books these days. The ability to write chapters that just flow one after another is not something many technical authors these days can accomplish. The book was very easy to read with sensible examples and well balanced code to content ratio.</p>  <p>I am a LINQ To SQL kinda guy and I’ve always had something against Entity Framework. I guess a part of it was my first benchmark which I did with Entity Framework version 1.0 and I was shocked to see abysmal performance. My second reason for staying away from EF was the fear of learning LINQ To Entities. This book took that fear away after one reading of the chapter on LINQ To Entities. BTW: Entity Framework 4 is a much better ORM than its predecessor and it is my preferred choice now.&#160; Microsoft has addressed most of the issues with performance.</p>  <p>Back to the book review. One thing which underwhelms me about programming books is either they have too much code or they don’t have much code at all. Julia maintained a perfect balance between code examples and explanatory text. </p>  <p>Chapters on Customizing Entities, POCOs and performance optimization are by themselves worth the money and time you’ll spend reading this book. </p>  <p>Overall a well written, highly enjoyable and substantially informative book. </p>  <p>Julia also maintains a site for this book <a href="http://learnentityframework.com/">LearningEntityFramework</a>.</p></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Once in a while I have to step out of the known environment of TFS and VSS and find myself in SVN land. Honestly I don’t mind SVN at all. In fact I think that certain features in SVN are much more intuitive and overall it’s a good source control system. If you work with Visual Studio and use SVN for source control then you need a SVN client which integrates well with Visual Studio. Till now there has been Visual SVN, but recently Axosoft announced their own product called Rocket SVN. I downloaded and installed Rocket SVN and I am using it with an online SVN repository. I have to say that I am impressed. Other than few icons which can be tidied up, the tool works without any issues.</p>

<p>Rocket SVN which is integrated with Visual Studio provides easily access information on pending changes.</p>

<p><img style="display: inline; border: 0px;" title="image" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B6PDO8HPEQZNZWpTRms0ZWtlaUU/uploads/2010/11/image.png" border="0" alt="image" width="450" height="450" /></p>

<p>You also get a repository explorer and a working copy explorer.</p>

<p><img style="display: inline; border: 0px;" title="image" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B6PDO8HPEQZNZWpTRms0ZWtlaUU/uploads/2010/11/image1.png" border="0" alt="image" width="450" height="450" /></p>

<p>Also within the Solution Explorer, Rocket SVN indicates with little icons the files that have changed and the files which have not.</p>

<p>I’ve been running Rocket SVN for last 3 days and I’m very happy with the tool.</p>

<p>Rocket SVN is <a href="http://axosoft.com/rocketsvn">available for free download</a>. Axosoft has indicated that sometime in future they will start charging for the product.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is to mark a little milestone for ThereforeSystems. My second post on this site was a <a href="http://www.debugrelease.com/linq-to-sql-tutorial/">LINQ To SQL Tutorial</a> which was a basic tutorial to get the reader started with LINQ To SQL. This post has also been one of the most popular I have ever written. I don’t check the site too often due to a busy schedule with work and family. However yesterday when I looked at the site I found that LINQ To SQL crossed 100,000 views. Even though this is miniscule compared to traffic that some other more established sites receive, I nevertheless thought this was a mini milestone which should be marked and celebrated. </p>


<p>  <p>As always, I thank the visitors and hope that content on ThereforeSystems has been helpful.</p></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hopefully most planet earth inhabitants know that Google pulled the plug on Wave or maybe most inhabitants who care about it. Together with my friend Graham we came up with these reasons for failure over a Japanese lunch today. Here’s the list.</p>


<p>  <ol>   <li>It did not ripple through masses.</li>    <li>The tide was not on it’s side.</li>    <li>It did not create waves in hearts or minds of people.</li>    <li>The sail was in opposite direction.</li>    <li>The product itself was shallow.</li> </ol>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>So it is finally time to wave it goodbye.</p> For the record this was getting way out of hand for our geeky minds and we were attracting unwanted attention at the restaurant. We decided to abandon the idea of coming out with more reasons.</p>
