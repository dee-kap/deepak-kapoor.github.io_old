<p>Last Thursday was the first meeting of vNext user group. Iâ€™d like to thank attendees for coming to the meeting and I hope that in return everyone learned something. Now to reflections. The turn out was about 50 people and we had plenty of toys to give out. I got great feedback on the presentation itself. Most of the comments were asking for more code and given that the crowd was mostly developers this is a fair comment. </p>  <p>This was also the first time I ran a user group meeting by myself and I now truly appreciate the effort user group leaders put in. I am confident that members of the community will be able to enjoy more interesting content in our future meetings where we will show off new tools and technologies coming out this year. </p>  <p>If you have any feedback, suggestions or comments then please drop me a line below and I will respond promptly. </p>
