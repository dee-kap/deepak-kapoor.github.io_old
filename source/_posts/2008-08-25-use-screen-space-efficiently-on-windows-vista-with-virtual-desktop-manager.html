Virtual Desktop Manager is tool which lets you create virtual desktops. You can run different applications in different virtual desktops which reduces clutter. Once you get used to working with it you start loving it. I have been using it for a while now and I cannot do without it anymore. You can download Virtual Desktop Manager from <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/vdm">Codeplex</a>.
