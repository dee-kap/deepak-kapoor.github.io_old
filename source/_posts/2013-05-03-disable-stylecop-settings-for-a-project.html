Tools like <a href="http://www.debugrelease.com/stylecop-tutorial/">StyleCop</a> have their place in the world and I have nothing against using them to produce consistently formatted code. It kinda makes the person higher up in the food chain brag to those higher above him about the quality of code being produced. However when I write code to try out things , I want the bloody thing to just go away and stop irritating me with you are missing a file header, using statements must be within namespace declaration etc.

It turns out that all the rules can be disabled easily by right clicking the project --&gt; StyleCop Settings. Then in the Rules tab by unchecking Enabled rules.
