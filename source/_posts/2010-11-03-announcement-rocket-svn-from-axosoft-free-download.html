Once in a while I have to step out of the known environment of TFS and VSS and find myself in SVN land. Honestly I don’t mind SVN at all. In fact I think that certain features in SVN are much more intuitive and overall it’s a good source control system. If you work with Visual Studio and use SVN for source control then you need a SVN client which integrates well with Visual Studio. Till now there has been Visual SVN, but recently Axosoft announced their own product called Rocket SVN. I downloaded and installed Rocket SVN and I am using it with an online SVN repository. I have to say that I am impressed. Other than few icons which can be tidied up, the tool works without any issues.

Rocket SVN which is integrated with Visual Studio provides easily access information on pending changes.

You also get a repository explorer and a working copy explorer.

Also within the Solution Explorer, Rocket SVN indicates with little icons the files that have changed and the files which have not.

I’ve been running Rocket SVN for last 3 days and I’m very happy with the tool.

Rocket SVN is <a href="http://axosoft.com/rocketsvn">available for free download</a>. Axosoft has indicated that sometime in future they will start charging for the product.
