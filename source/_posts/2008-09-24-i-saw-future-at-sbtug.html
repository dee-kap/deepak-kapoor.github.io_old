After many months I attended SBTUG today. I have always found the presentations at <a href="http://www.sbtug.com">SBTUG</a> to be informative and more importantly entertaining. There are times when I feel like consuming content which is bit light on programming but still related to IT. And SBTUG provides that perfect mix. Today's presentations were Predicting the Past: Emotional Design and Vision for Microsoft Surface by <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/design/People/Detail.aspx?key=august">August de los Reyes</a> and The Evolution of Enterprise Software Development by <a href="http://www.notgartner.com">Mitch Denny</a>.

August is a great presenter and I felt that his presentation was well structured and very well rehearsed. It was insightful to learn about the vision, thoughts and research that went into designing Surface. August also showed a video on future of personal health concepts. All I have to say about the video is that I want all that stuff now.

Due to a previously planned family commitment I missed the second presentation. Sorry Mitch.

This is the video August showed at SBTUG.
