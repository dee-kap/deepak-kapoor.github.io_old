This is a review of the book.</p>  <p>Julia has written a book which targets a broad spectrum of EF expertise. If you are a beginner then this book is for you to learn Entity Framework. If you are an expert then this book is for you to learn advance Entity Framework concepts. Her writing style is seldom found in technical books these days. The ability to write chapters that just flow one after another is not something many technical authors these days can accomplish. The book was very easy to read with sensible examples and well balanced code to content ratio.</p>  <p>I am a LINQ To SQL kinda guy and I’ve always had something against Entity Framework. I guess a part of it was my first benchmark which I did with Entity Framework version 1.0 and I was shocked to see abysmal performance. My second reason for staying away from EF was the fear of learning LINQ To Entities. This book took that fear away after one reading of the chapter on LINQ To Entities. BTW: Entity Framework 4 is a much better ORM than its predecessor and it is my preferred choice now.&#160; Microsoft has addressed most of the issues with performance.</p>  <p>Back to the book review. One thing which underwhelms me about programming books is either they have too much code or they don’t have much code at all. Julia maintained a perfect balance between code examples and explanatory text. </p>  <p>Chapters on Customizing Entities, POCOs and performance optimization are by themselves worth the money and time you’ll spend reading this book. </p>  <p>Overall a well written, highly enjoyable and substantially informative book. </p>  <p>Julia also maintains a site for this book <a href="http://learnentityframework.com/">LearningEntityFramework</a>.</p>
