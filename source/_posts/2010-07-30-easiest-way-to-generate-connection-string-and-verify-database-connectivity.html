<p>There are two things which I as a consultant / developer come across many times. One is verifying connectivity to a database which is often a cause of production issues and second is creating valid connection string in the least amount of time. This is the way I do it. Hopefully it will be of help to you.</p>  <p>First of all forget that you have Visual Studio, SSMS or anything so big and fancy. You just want to get a connection string baked up pronto. I usually end up creating a .udl file. UDL which stands for Universal Data Link allows you to establish a connection and then stores the connection string in text format. Doing this is very simple. Create a file in any folder or desktop and call it <strong>test.udl</strong>. </p>  <p>Now double click the file and you’ll get a window where you can enter your connection properties.</p>  <p>&#160;<img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.debugrelease.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/image2.png" width="377" height="473" /> </p>  <p>You can also select different providers.</p>  <p><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.debugrelease.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/image3.png" width="377" height="473" /> </p>  <p>Once you have filled in the information about your server, security and database just click on Test Connection to verify connectivity. Click OK to close the window.</p>  <p>To get a connection string with information you just entered just open the test.udl file in a text editor and you’ll see the connection string. </p>  <p>&#160;<img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.debugrelease.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/image4.png" width="582" height="68" /> </p>  <p>That’s it. Simple and easy ninja style.</p>
