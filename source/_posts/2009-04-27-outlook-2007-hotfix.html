<p>If you have been having issues with Outlook 2007 related to performance, erratic behaviour and just annoyance in general then this hotfix maybe what you need. Released in February 2007 the patch fixes many issues which can make working with Outlook 2007 a punishment. I installed it today morning and itâ€™s been working fine and dandy for me. </p>  <p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=961752">Link to Hotfix.</a></p>
