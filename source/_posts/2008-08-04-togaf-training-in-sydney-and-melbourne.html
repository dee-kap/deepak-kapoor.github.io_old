Vish Viswanathan is conducting his famous TOGAF training course in Sydney and Melbourne in the month of September. I have attended his course in Sydney and I can confidently say that Vish is one of the finest trainers I have met. The best part of his course is the interaction among attendees. After the course I left with a much better understanding of Enterprise Architecture.

So if you are looking to get TOGAF certification or you are working in an environment where TOGAF is used or will be used then this course is worth the buck.

You can find more details about the course and fees <a href="http://www.ccandcsolutions.com/">here</a>.
