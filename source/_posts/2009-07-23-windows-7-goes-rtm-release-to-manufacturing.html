Microsoft’s new Operating System is scheduled to be available to available to public around October 22. MSDN and TechNet subscribers will be able to download Windows 7 in next few weeks, most likely around August 6. Comparing to release of Vista this looks much more well executed. Windows 7 has received more positive press than any other OS by Microsoft. This in my opinion is how expectations were managed. Rather than coming out with hyped up features which never made it to the product (read WinFS) Windows 7 managed communication to the best. </p>  <p>I’m starting the countdown to when I can download Windows 7.</p>  <p>You can read more about it on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2009/jul09/07-22Windows7RTMPR.mspx">Microsoft Press Pass site</a>.</p>
