When starting Eclipse on Windows 7 I came across this error “Failed to load the JNI shared library”. After many trials and errors the solution revealed itself. The problem was that I did not have 64 bit JVM on my machine. I had been running 32 bit JVM and that was the culprit. <strong>If you get this error then Install 64 bit JVM</strong>. <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp">Here is a link</a> where you can find 64 bit JVM.
