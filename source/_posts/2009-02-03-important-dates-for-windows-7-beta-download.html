<p><strong>Update On Windows 7 Beta Download Dates. Thanks Jeff</strong></p>  <blockquote>   <p>&#8220;<font color="#000080">Final days: We're just about at the limit for Beta downloads, so act now if you want to try Windows 7.&#8221;       <br />It is my understanding that it is possible that the download link is capped before the 10th, depending on what the &#8220;limit&#8221; is and if this number is reached before the 10th.</font></p> </blockquote>  <p>Here are some dates for Windows 7 Beta which you should be aware of especially if you are planning to download the beta. </p>  <ol dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px">   <ol>     <ol>       <ol>         <ol>           <ol>             <ol>               <li>Starting January 27th, the Windows 7 page will be updated with a warning that time is running out on downloading the Windows 7 Beta and that we will be limiting downloads shortly. People will be encouraged to register and start the download of the Windows 7 Beta sooner rather than later.                  <br /></li>                <li>&#160; February 10th, new downloads of the Windows 7 Beta will no longer be available. People who have already started their Windows 7 Beta download and have not yet finished will still be able to finish their download and are encouraged to do so.                  <br /></li>                <li>&#160; February 12th, people will no longer be able to complete their download of the Windows 7 Beta.
