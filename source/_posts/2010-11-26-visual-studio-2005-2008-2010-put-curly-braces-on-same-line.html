I have been looking at some code from Microsoft and I found that in C# they keep curly braces on the same line. This is also the preferred style in Java. Since I also write Java code these days I decided to keep the same style for curly braces.

So how do you configure Visual Studio to place curly braces on the same line? It turns out that there are options which allow you to do this. In Visual Studio go to Tools –&gt; Options –&gt; Text Editor –&gt; C# –&gt; Formatting and toggle check boxes under New line options for braces.

<img style="margin: 0px 10px 10px; display: inline;" title="image" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B6PDO8HPEQZNZWpTRms0ZWtlaUU/uploads/2010/11/image31.png" alt="image" width="538" height="440" />

This will not affect  existing code but any new code you write will honour these new settings.
