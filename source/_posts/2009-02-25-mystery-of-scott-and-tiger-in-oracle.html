<p>I found this very interesting.</p>  <p>When you install Oracle, a user by the name of Scott is always created for you. This users’ password is Tiger. The user is actually named after Bruce Scott who was one of the first employees at Oracle and Tiger was his cat’s name.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.go4expert.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2252">Original Source.</a></p>
