Working through Force.com tutorials I came to the point where I wrote some Apex code. Instead of doing this via Browser based interface, I decided to use Force.com IDE which as you know is an Eclipse plugin. This post documents the steps I went through to get connectivity to the warehouse application created as part of the tutorial.

I created a new Force.com project in IDE and entered my username and password.

Things did not go well and I got the following message.

But I thought that I already have a security token. I've been logging into developer.force.com from this computer. However I decided to follow the suggestion in the message and logged into developer.force.com and went through the Reset Security Token process.

I got the token emailed to me and used is as per the instructions on Reset Security Token page. The instruction is to append the token to the password.

And finally I was connected.

I could now see my project in the project explorer.
