<p>I have been asked many times about the font I use in Visual Studio. Colleagues who visit my cubicle often admire how I have setup Visual Studio or my text editor. The code just looks better on my machine than it does on theirs :) The answer lies in the font and color scheme.</p>

<p>I use Ubuntu Font for all my code editors. This includes Visual Studio, Sublime Text and WebStorm. Earlier I was hooked to Consolas but ever since I discovered Ubuntu Font, I cannot tolerate anything else.</p>

<p>Changing font in Visual Studio can be done by going to Tools --&gt; Options. Then go to Environment --&gt; Fonts and colors<p>

<p>In Sublime Text go to Preferences --&gt; Settings-User and add the following text between curly braces.</p>
 
<pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">"font_face": "Ubuntu mono",
"font_size": 12</pre>
