<p>BigInsights web console error in IBM Infosphere BigInsights VM usually occurs because web console is not running. It can be started by executing start.sh which can be found in /opt/ibm/biginsights/bin. I discovered this issue while working through lab 3 of Hadoop Fundamentals 1 course from <a href="http://bigdatauniversity.com/">BigDataUniversity</a>. </p> <p>Steps to resolve the issue:</p> <p>Assuming that you are logged in as root. Execute these commands on terminal.</p> <p><font color="#0000ff">cd /opt/ibm/biginsights/bin</font></p> <p><font color="#0000ff">./start.sh console</font></p>
