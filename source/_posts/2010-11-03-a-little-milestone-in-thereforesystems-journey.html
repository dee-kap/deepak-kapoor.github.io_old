<p>This post is to mark a little milestone for ThereforeSystems. My second post on this site was a <a href="http://www.debugrelease.com/linq-to-sql-tutorial/">LINQ To SQL Tutorial</a> which was a basic tutorial to get the reader started with LINQ To SQL. This post has also been one of the most popular I have ever written. I donâ€™t check the site too often due to a busy schedule with work and family. However yesterday when I looked at the site I found that LINQ To SQL crossed 100,000 views. Even though this is miniscule compared to traffic that some other more established sites receive, I nevertheless thought this was a mini milestone which should be marked and celebrated. </p>  <p>As always, I thank the visitors and hope that content on ThereforeSystems has been helpful.</p>
