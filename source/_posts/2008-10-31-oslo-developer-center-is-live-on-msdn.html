<img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; float: left; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B6PDO8HPEQZNZWpTRms0ZWtlaUU/uploads/2008/10/image5.png" border="0" alt="image" width="183" height="77" /> An exciting news I found while reading <a href="http://sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=2196">Marquee de Sells</a> is the launch of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/oslo/default.aspx">Oslo Developer Center</a>. I have been following Oslo story for sometime now and I have to say that information has only trickled so far. Oslo Developer Center is the first step in taking the covers off Oslo and educating the masses about it with a flow of information. Microsoft has not committed to the release date/period for Oslo but given that teams have been working on it for what seems to be a long time, it should not be too far (I am speculating here).

If you are interesting in learning more about Oslo then may I recommend that you start with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd129873.aspx">Oslo FAQs</a> which answers important questions such as What is Oslo? The answer (partially taken from Oslo FAQ) is:
<blockquote>"Oslo" is the code name for our platform for model-driven applications. The goal of “Oslo” is to provide a 10x productivity gain by making model-driven applications mainstream</blockquote>
10x productivity! You've got my attention.
