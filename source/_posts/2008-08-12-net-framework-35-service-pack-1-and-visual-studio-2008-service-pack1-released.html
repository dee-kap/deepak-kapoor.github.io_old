Yippeee! SP1 for .Net 3.5 and Visual Studio 2008 has been released. This service pack includes ADO.NET Entity Framework and ADO.NET Data Services. There are WPF designer improvements and WPF performance improvements. You can find more details and download link <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts2008/products/cc533447.aspx">here</a>.

Finally I can now install SQL Server 2008 without disturbing the apple cart :)
