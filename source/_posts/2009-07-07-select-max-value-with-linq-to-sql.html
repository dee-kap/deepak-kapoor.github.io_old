Today I was asked a question by a developer on my team. The question is “How do you select MAX value for a column in a table with LINQ To SQL?”. I will try to answer the question in this post with an example. Let’s say that we want to retrieve maximum unit price from Products table in Northwind database. In T-SQL such a query can be written like this.

 
<pre class="lang:tsql decode:true " >SELECT MAX(UnitPrice)
FROM products</pre> 


Query above produces the correct result.

In LINQ To SQL we can write the following query

 
<pre class="lang:c# decode:true " >(from p in Products select (p.UnitPrice)).Max()  </pre> 


which will get translated into this T-SQL.

<img style="display: inline; border-width: 0px;" title="image" alt="image" src="http://www.debugrelease.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/image1.png" width="294" height="36" border="0" />

Other than MAX we can also use other aggregates such as MIN, SUM etc..
