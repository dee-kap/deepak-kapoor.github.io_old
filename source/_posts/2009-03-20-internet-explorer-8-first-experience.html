<p>I’ll be honest that I was not much excited about Internet Explorer 8 until it went RTM. There is only so much beta software one can take. But today when IE8 went RTM I decided to install it on my main machine. This post talks about my first experience with the browser. </p>  <p>Installation of IE8 is one of the best I’ve ever seen.&#160; The thing installed itself in less than 2 minutes. Good on you Microsoft. It did ask me to restart my machine and I happily obliged. After the restart I fired up the browser and was presented with a Set Up Windows Internet Explorer 8 wizard. Here are the screenshots from that wizard. BTW: I run Windows 2008 Server on my main machine as my workstation.</p>  <p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="Internet Explorer 8" border="0" alt="Internet Explorer 8" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B6PDO8HPEQZNZWpTRms0ZWtlaUU/uploads/2009/03/image26.png" width="540" height="400" /> </p>  <p>Next screen asked me if I wanted IE to discover websites based on the sites I visit. Sure! Why not. The way this works is that Microsoft gathers data about the sites you browse and makes recommendations about similar sites. I usually turn such features off but just to see how it works I left it on. If it does a good job then I will leave it on forever. You can read the Internet Explorer Privacy Statement if you are concerned about what data will be collected. The Privacy Statement can be found <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/privacy.aspx">here</a>.</p>  <p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="Internet Explorer 8" border="0" alt="Internet Explorer 8" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B6PDO8HPEQZNZWpTRms0ZWtlaUU/uploads/2009/03/image35.png" width="540" height="400" /> </p>  <p>Next screen asked me if I’d like to use express settings or custom settings. I always choose custom settings so that I know what is being installed. After choosing custom settings and clicking on the Next button, the first screen allowed me to configure my search provider. I opted to keep my search provider.</p>  <p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="Internet Explorer 8" border="0" alt="Internet Explorer 8" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B6PDO8HPEQZNZWpTRms0ZWtlaUU/uploads/2009/03/image28.png" width="540" height="400" /></p>  <p> After this I was asked if I wanted to download updates for search provider. What is this? I don’t understand so it’s a no.</p>  <p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="Internet Explorer 8" border="0" alt="Internet Explorer 8" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B6PDO8HPEQZNZWpTRms0ZWtlaUU/uploads/2009/03/image29.png" width="540" height="400" /> </p>  <p>Next screen is for accelerators. Accelerators are a new addition to Internet Explorer. Here is what help has to say about accelerators.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>You can use Accelerators with text that you select on a webpage to perform such tasks as opening a street address in a mapping website or looking up the dictionary definition for a word. You can also choose the web services or websites that Accelerators use to handle different types of tasks. Internet Explorer 8 comes with a selection of Accelerators included by default, but you can add or remove them as you like.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I decided to keep my current accelerators. </p>  <p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="Internet Explorer 8" border="0" alt="Internet Explorer 8" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B6PDO8HPEQZNZWpTRms0ZWtlaUU/uploads/2009/03/image30.png" width="540" height="400" /> </p>  <p>Then I was asked about SmartScreen Filters. Turning this on means that some websites addresses will be sent to Microsoft where they can be checked for being malicious, fraudulent types. Because I do not go to any such sites, I decided to turn this off. </p>  <p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="Internet Explorer 8" border="0" alt="Internet Explorer 8" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B6PDO8HPEQZNZWpTRms0ZWtlaUU/uploads/2009/03/image31.png" width="540" height="400" /> </p>  <p>Next screen was about Compatibility Settings. Turning this on will make sites designed for older browsers look better (whatever that means) in IE8. Because I want to see how old sites look in IE8 in their raw form, I decided to turn this off. Of course this can be turned on at anytime.</p>  <p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="Internet Explorer 8" border="0" alt="Internet Explorer 8" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B6PDO8HPEQZNZWpTRms0ZWtlaUU/uploads/2009/03/image32.png" width="540" height="400" /> </p>  <p>And that’s about it. I clicked on the Finish button and I was all ready to browse the World Wide Web. The first site I opened in IE8 is <a href="http://www.debugrelease.com/">One .Net Way</a>. Just typing one in the address bar presented me with a history of sites I have visited with the word “one” in them.</p>  <p>&#160;<img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="Internet Explorer 8" border="0" alt="Internet Explorer 8" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B6PDO8HPEQZNZWpTRms0ZWtlaUU/uploads/2009/03/image33.png" width="530" height="219" /> </p>  <p>Right away I was impressed by the performance. Drop down on address bar with my history items was very fast. </p>  <p>Overall experience of upgrading to Internet Explorer 8 has been good. I can’t say that I am disappointed with anything so far. I am sure that Microsoft has put in tremendous effort to get it right and more so because of the competition in the browser market. My overall gut feel about IE 8 is good. I’ll be using it a bit more and I will post anything I find interesting. </p>  <p>Finally here is a screenshot of One .Net Way in Internet Explorer 8.</p>  <p>&#160;<img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="Internet Explorer 8" border="0" alt="Internet Explorer 8" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B6PDO8HPEQZNZWpTRms0ZWtlaUU/uploads/2009/03/image34.png" width="540" height="450" /></p>
