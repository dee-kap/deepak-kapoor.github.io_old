Microsoft will launch <a href="http://videomessages.live.com/portal/preview/default.html">Live Video Messaging</a> facility on 9th September 2008. I have not yet sent anyone a video message in my life, so I am a bit excited to see something like this. At present you can request an early beta access if you are a member of press. I write a blog, does that make me a member of press? Or maybe I'll just hold on till 9th September which is not too far. Definitely a service to look out for.
