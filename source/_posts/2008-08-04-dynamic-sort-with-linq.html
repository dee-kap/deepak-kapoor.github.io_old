In this post I will show you how to perform dynamic sorting with LINQ. I will work with a simple collection of City class. City class is defined below.

<code lang="csharp">
public class City
{
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public string Country { get; set; }
}
</code>

The collection is initialised using this code

<code lang="csharp">
List<City> cities = new List<City>
  {
    new City{ Name = "Sydney", Country = "Australia" },
    new City{ Name = "New York", Country = "USA" },
    new City{ Name = "Paris", Country = "France" },
    new City{ Name = "Milan", Country = "Spain" },
    new City{ Name = "Melbourne", Country = "Australia" },
    new City{ Name = "Auckland", Country = "New Zealand" },
    new City{ Name = "Tokyo", Country = "Japan" },
    new City{ Name = "New Delhi", Country = "India" },
    new City{ Name = "Hobart", Country = "Australia" }
  };
</code>

A typical example of applying a sort will be to write such a query.

<code lang="csharp">
var collection =
  from c in cities
  orderby c.Country
  select c;
</code>
Here we are sorting the collection on country. Note that this is static in nature.

Code above as you can see can only sort by country. If I wanted to sort by city name then I'd be writing another query and maybe use a conditional construct such as if or switch and write a method which takes in a parameter. While this will work, it is not the best way to do it.

LINQ gives us the ability to make our code dynamic. I can provide sort functionality for my query by writing a method which takes in a Func&lt;TElement, TKey&gt; delegate. This delegate is used by the OrderBy extension method. This is how I can write my method.

<code lang="csharp">
public static void Sort<TKey>(List<City> cities, Func<City, TKey> selector)
{
  var sortedCollection =
    from c in cities
    orderby selector(c)
    select c;

  foreach (var item in sortedCollection)
  {
    Console.WriteLine(item.Name);
  }
}
</code>

This method can be called like this by passing in the cities collection which has been initialised earlier.

<code lang="csharp">
Sort(cities, c => c.Name);
</code>

I can also sort by country without changing my query. To sort by country I just need to call my sort method like this.

<code lang="csharp">
Sort(cities, c => c.Country);
</code>

LINQ is very powerful when you start using it on daily bases. It would not be very useful if everything was static. In this post I showed you how you can make your sorting code dynamic. Stay tuned for more LINQ goodness.
