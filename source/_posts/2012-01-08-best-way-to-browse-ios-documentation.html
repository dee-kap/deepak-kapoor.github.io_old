<p>While developing apps for iPhone or iPad I often have to look into documentation. IMO the experience of browsing through documentation within XCode is not the best. Today I found this great Mac application which so far is the best way to browse through iOS documentation. The application I am talking about is called Dash. It is also a code snippet manager where you can put frequently used code snippets. This is a must have for iOS or Mac developers.</p>

<p>Dash can be found on iTunes. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/dash/id458034879">http://itunes.apple.com/app/dash/id458034879</a></p>
