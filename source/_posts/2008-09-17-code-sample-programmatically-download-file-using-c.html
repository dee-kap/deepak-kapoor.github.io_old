While browsing forums today I came across a question which asked for a solution to download a file from a web server programmatically. The solution is very simple and below is the code which achieves the goal. Here I am downloading a file asynchronously on Button Click.

<pre class="lang:c# decode:true " >
private void buttonDownloadFile_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
	string url
		= @"http://www.debugrelease.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/image35.png";

	// Create an instance of WebClient
	WebClient client = new WebClient();

	// Hookup DownloadFileCompleted Event
	client.DownloadFileCompleted +=
	new AsyncCompletedEventHandler(client_DownloadFileCompleted);

	// Start the download and copy the file to c:temp
	client.DownloadFileAsync(new Uri(url), @"c:tempimage35.png");
 }

 void client_DownloadFileCompleted(object sender, AsyncCompletedEventArgs e)
 {
	MessageBox.Show("File downloaded");
 }
</pre>

You can also download the file synchronously using WebClient.DownloadFile() method.
