<p>According to <a href="http://marketshare.hitslink.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=0">Market Share</a> Google Chrome has 1% of browser market share. I am sure I must be a part of that statistics because I have Chrome installed on one of machines, and I think of it as just another browser. Although integrating search into address bar is a clever feature but again it is just a browser for me. After reading browser statistics on Market Share I decided to have a look at analytics for this site to see the browser share. Here is a chart:</p>  <p>&#160;<img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="290" alt="image" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B6PDO8HPEQZNZWpTRms0ZWtlaUU/uploads/2008/12/image.png" width="498" border="0" /> </p>  <p>Yu can see that Chrome ranks third after IE and Firefox. Six percent readers of this site use Chrome. Now I assume that most of my readers are people who work with Microsoft technologies and most likely developers. Does this mean that developers are embracing Chrome. Of course I do not have any hard data to back up the assertion but it is still worth a thought.</p>  <p>Are you a developer? Do you use Google Chrome?</p>
