<p>Some of you may know that author of this site (that’s me in case you are thinking) is attending his first ever TechEd. TechEd to me is like woodstock for developers and other IT people who come in masses for this amazing and full of geek energy event. Over next few posts I will write about my experience of TechEd.</p>  <h3>Day 1</h3>  <p>Technically today was not the first day of TechEd but it was for me. I arrived at Gold Coast after a pleasant 1 point something hour flight. Meeting familiar people at Gold Coast airport who were also headed to TechEd got me into TechEd groove right away. I checked into my hotel which is in front of Convention Centre and the best part is that I can get a panoramic view of Convention Centre from my window. Wasting no time I went straight to Convention Centre for registration and picked up my Netbook, picked up my delegate bag (to be reviewed soon) and headed to exhibition hall where I caught up with <a href="http://www.lobsterpot.com.au">Rob Farley</a> and finally met Deeps. For those who have confused me with <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/user/Profile.aspx?UserID=5777">Deeps</a> I can now logically prove that we are two different people. Exhibition hall was buzzing with activity and you could feel geek vibes all over the place. </p>  <p>I took some pictures which you can view down below. But before you do that I have a WTF to report on. Drums please. WTF for today was found inside delegate bag within HP folder. There is a pamphlet which says HP recommends Vista Business. </p>  <p> Registration booths at TechEd Australia.</p>  <p><a title="IMG_0167 by deepakkapoor, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/deepakkapoor/3899449713/"><img alt="IMG_0167" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2448/3899449713_9bbc3d5fa2.jpg" width="500" height="375" /></a> </p>  <p> Me holding my HP Netbook.

Not booted yet.</p> <a title="IMG_0172 by deepakkapoor, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/deepakkapoor/3899449735/"><img alt="IMG_0172" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2525/3899449735_9c5d8e2f1d.jpg" width="375" height="500" /></a>   <p>More tomorrow…</p>
