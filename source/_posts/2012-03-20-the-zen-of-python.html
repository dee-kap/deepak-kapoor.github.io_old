<p>These days I am doing a great amount of work using Python. If you are game to learn a new language then I highly recommend looking at Python. You will find it both <a href="http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/20493/Why-PHP-Is-Fun-and-Easy-But-Python-Is-Marriage-Material.aspx">fun and productive</a>. Basic tenets of the language can be summarized in what is called “The Zen of Python”.</p> <p>The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters</p> <ul> <li>Beautiful is better than ugly.</li> <li>Explicit is better than implicit.</li> <li>Simple is better than complex.</li> <li>Complex is better than complicated.</li> <li>Flat is better than nested.</li> <li>Sparse is better than dense.</li> <li>Readability counts.</li> <li>Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.</li> <li>Although practicality beats purity.</li> <li>Errors should never pass silently.</li> <li>Unless explicitly silenced.</li> <li>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</li> <li>There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.</li> <li>Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.</li> <li>Now is better than never.</li> <li>Although never is often better than *right* now.</li> <li>If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.</li> <li>If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.</li> <li>Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</li></ul> <p>Where did I get this from? Well, from Python itself. Just type <font style="background-color: #cccccc" color="#0000ff">&nbsp; import this&nbsp; </font> on Python prompt.</p>
