<p>Keynote for TechEd Australia started a bit slow with too much concentration on words such as innovation, excitement and productivity. Keynote was saved by awesome presentations by Sara Ford and Sarah Vaughan. Rest of the day was fantastic. A combination of excellent topics and superb presentation skills made it a worthy learning day. </p>  <p>The best presentation of the day which I attended was by <a href="http://damianedwards.wordpress.com/">Damian Edwards</a> on ASP.NET MVC. Well structured and full of useful information. ASP.NET MVC is my current focus and that made the presentation even more interesting for me . Well done Damian. </p>  <p>I also attended a talk on BizSpark by <a href="http://blog.rog42.net/">Rog42</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/chlong/">Christian Longstaff</a>. Biz Spark is a great program for startups and if you are one then you should definitely look at it. Where else can you get a suite of world class software at $100 which is payable in third year. I’m thinking that I might consider it for my company.</p>  <p>I also enjoyed Sharepoint presentation by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/acoat/">Andrew Coates</a> and <a href="http://wss.made4the.net/default.aspx">Jeremy Thake</a>. Their presentation was well synchronised and full of Sharepoint goodness. I’m not too much into Sharepoint but even I picked up points which I could use if god forbid I have to do any Sharepoint work again.</p>
