<p>I got a message on Facebook from my friend Rajnesh who said that while he was delighted to see my <a href="http://www.twitter.com/deepakkapoor">Twitter</a> updates which were both motivational and inspiring, he found that the flow of wisdom was a bit too much . Okay, he did not say that exactly but basically my Twitter updates are showing up on his wall and they are let’s just say too many.</p>  <p>So the question is how do you hide them? And the simple answer is that you can hide all updates from a friend on Facebook. This can easily be done by clicking on the arrow next to Hide which appears when you take your mouse towards top right on a message on your wall. And then by clicking “Hide &lt;Your Friend’s Name&gt;”.</p>  <p>And that’s it. You will not see that flood of Twitter status updates from your friend.</p>  <p><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="Facebook Hide On Wall" border="0" alt="Facebook Hide On Wall" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B6PDO8HPEQZNZWpTRms0ZWtlaUU/uploads/2009/05/image33.png" width="540" height="322" /></p>
