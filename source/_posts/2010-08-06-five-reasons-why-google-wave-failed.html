<p>Hopefully most planet earth inhabitants know that Google pulled the plug on Wave or maybe most inhabitants who care about it. Together with my friend Graham we came up with these reasons for failure over a Japanese lunch today. Here’s the list.</p>  <ol>   <li>It did not ripple through masses.</li>    <li>The tide was not on it’s side.</li>    <li>It did not create waves in hearts or minds of people.</li>    <li>The sail was in opposite direction.</li>    <li>The product itself was shallow.</li> </ol>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>So it is finally time to wave it goodbye.</p> For the record this was getting way out of hand for our geeky minds and we were attracting unwanted attention at the restaurant. We decided to abandon the idea of coming out with more reasons.
