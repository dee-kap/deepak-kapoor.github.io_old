<p>SQL Search by Red-Gate is a great tool for searching within database objects. It is invaluable on brown field projects where you work with existing databases. My recent experience was working with a database which had hundreds of Stored procedures, Views, Triggers etc. I had to find out all objects which used a particular table. <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/SQL_Search/">SQL Search</a> made this job a breeze. SQL Search does a text search across all database objects so you can also look for things like column names.</p>  <p>Taking an example of Northwind database. You could to search for all database objects which have the word “customer” in their text. Below is a screenshot showing the search results.</p>  <p>&#160;<img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B6PDO8HPEQZNZWpTRms0ZWtlaUU/uploads/2010/11/image29.png" width="539" height="561" /> </p>  <p>The best thing is that <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/SQL_Search/">SQL Search</a> is free. </p>
