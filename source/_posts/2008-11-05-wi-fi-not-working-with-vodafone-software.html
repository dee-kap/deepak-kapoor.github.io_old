As a part of my job I often travel around Sydney so I use a <a href="http://www.vodafone.com.au">Vodafone mobile Internet</a> connection to keep myself connected. At home I connect to my wireless network. Recently I faced a problem with my <a href="http://www.hardwarezone.com.au/reviews/view.php?cid=14&amp;id=2700">new laptop</a>. The issue was that I could not connect to wireless network at home. After many attempts to repair, renew my IP address and apply other tricks I decided to uninstall Vodafone software. After uninstalling Vodafone software I could connect to Wi-Fi. But I need to connect to mobile internet when I am on road. Thankfully I found the solution to my problem
<h4>Solution</h4>
Ditch the Vodafone software and start using <a href="http://www.nerve.org.za/mdma/">MDMA (Mobile Data Monitoring Application)</a>. MDMA does not require you to install anything and works without any problems. I can now connect to mobile Internet and to Wi-Fi without any fuss.

<a href="http://www.nerve.org.za/mdma/">MDMA</a> is also very light weight and has a small memory footprint.

You can <a href="http://www.nerve.org.za/mdma/">download MDMA here</a>.
