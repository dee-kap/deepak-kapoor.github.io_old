<p>After using notepad++ for many years, I recently switched over to HippoEDIT as my preferred text editor. I find HippoEdit to be snappier than other text editor and the UI also looks appealing. Just wanted to give them a plug here. </p>  <p><a href="http://www.hippoedit.com/download.php?lang=en">Download</a> HippoEDIT and see it for yourself. </p>  <p><img alt="HippoEDIT Overview" src="http://www.hippoedit.com/images/screenshot_small.gif" /></p>
