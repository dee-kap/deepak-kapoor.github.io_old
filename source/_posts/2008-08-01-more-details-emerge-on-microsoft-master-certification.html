Few weeks ago Microsoft announced a new certification called <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/master/default.mspx">Microsoft Certified Master</a>. In an ever growing cluster of Microsoft certification this one allows you to specialise in a particular technology area. So what does this mean? Aren't other certifications specialising as well? According to Microsoft, Master certification is intended towards candidates who spend most of their time working with one product. This is different than your average developer who needs to know about many technologies such as ASP.NET, SQL Server, WCF, WFP etc.
<h4>Master Tracks</h4>
At present Microsoft has announced Master certifications for Windows Server 2008, Exchange Server 2007 and SQL Server 2008. Other Master certifications in pipeline are for SharePoint Server 2007 and Office Communications Server 2007.
<h4>How do I get one?</h4>
The process to achieve the master status includes a three week training course in Redmond. You then have to write three written exams and in addition you must clear one lab exam.
<h4>When can I enrol?</h4>
Registration process is expected to start within one month.
<h4>How much does it cost?</h4>
Now this is a big one. The cost of Master Certification is $18,500 USD. This straight away puts it off radar for a majority of population. But if you break it up then you are paying approximately $6000 per week to be trained by some of the best brains in the world. On weekly based this is not much more than what you would pay for a specialising technology course.
<h4>How do I prepare?</h4>
This is not the kind of certification where you an buy a book and read it page-to-page and then work all the examples out and you are ready for exam. In my opinion, you will walk into the course being an expert++ and you will be polished and given more knowledge than mere mortals in the training course.
<h4>What do people think?</h4>
From what I can observe after talking to friends, colleagues and by reading blogs that Master Certification is receiving mixed signals. After not so jubilant reception of Microsoft Certified Architect many people are questioning the benefits of Master Certification. But this is yet to be verified.
