<p>Since last few days I noticed a significant decline in performance on my mac. After opening about 8 different apps my machine would become irritatingly unresponsive. Now macs don't slow down, or do they? Well the fact is that they do and this could be because of a number of reasons. In my case it was due to lack of empty space on my hard drive. So it was time for a clean up. I started by deleting music files which I would never listen to. Then I started thinking about other stuff I can do without and which comes with Mac OSX pre-installed. Language files happened to be one such culprit. In reality I don't use anything other than English on my machine. Maybe once in a while I read stuff in hindi but that's about it.</p>
<p>To clean up unnecessary language resources I found a utility called <a href="http://monolingual.sourceforge.net/" title="Monolingual">Monolingual</a>. It removes files for languages you do not need. After running the utility, I gained 2.1GB of disk space.</p>
