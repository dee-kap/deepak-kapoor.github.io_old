<p>As developers we are always excited about latest technologies, and as a developer working in Microsoft eco-system there is no shortage of new tools and technologies. This is the driving point behind starting vNext User Group. The group aims to share knowledge about offerings from Microsoft which are in pipeline i.e they are to be released in future. </p>  <p>vNext is an extension of <a href="http://www.sdnug.org">SDNUG</a> which has been running in Sydney for more than seven years. At this stage vNext announcements will be made via SDNUG website and mailing list so members will not miss out on meeting info.&#160; The group meets at the same location as SDNUG on first Thursday of alternate months. To make things clear here is the schedule of meetings for both vNext and SDNUG for year 2009. </p>  <p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="vNext" border="0" alt="vNext" src="http://www.debugrelease.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/image7.png" width="353" height="452" /> </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>For our first meeting on Thursday 7th May 6:00pm to 8:00pm I am doing a presentation on Cloud Computing in which I will talk about Microsoft Azure and what it means for .Net developers. Pizza will be provided and there will be many goodies for attendees to take home. </p>  <p>On an emotional note this is a big step for me and I hope that I am able to serve developer community. Of course I need your wishes for this. What better way than to come to the meeting and give them to me in person :)</p>
