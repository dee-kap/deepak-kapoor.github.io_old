<a href="http://devexpress.com/">Developer Express</a> the company that produces some of the best third party control libraries for .NET also have two very popular products for developer productivity. These products are CodeRush and Refactor Pro retailing for approximately $250. They have now released a free edition of CodeRush called CodeRush Xpress which can be downloaded <a href="http://downloads.devexpress.com/IDETools/CodeRushX/CodeRushXpress-3.2.1.exe">here</a>.

Even though Xpress edition is trimmed as compared to the full edition, it still offers some extremely helpful features. Some of my favourites are around Refactorings. Here is list of refactorings offered by CodeRush Xpress.
<ul>
	<li>Add/Remove Block Delimiters</li>
	<li>Combine Conditionals (merge nested "If" statements)</li>
	<li>Compress to Lambda Expression</li>
	<li>Compress to Ternary Expression</li>
	<li>Convert to Auto-implemented Property</li>
	<li>Convert to Initializer (use object/collection initialize when possible)</li>
	<li>Create Backing Store (converts Auto-implemented Property to standard Property with get and set)</li>
	<li>Decompose Initializer</li>
	<li>Decompose Parameter</li>
	<li>Expand Lambda Expression</li>
	<li>Expand Ternary Expression</li>
	<li>Extract Method to Type</li>
	<li>Flatten Conditional</li>
	<li>Introduce Local (introduce variable)</li>
	<li>Inline Delegate</li>
	<li>Inline Temp (inline variable)</li>
	<li>Make Explicit</li>

</ul>
