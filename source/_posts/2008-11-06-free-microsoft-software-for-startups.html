<img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; float: left; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B6PDO8HPEQZNZWpTRms0ZWtlaUU/uploads/2008/11/image4.png" border="0" alt="BizSpark" width="207" height="55" /> For many startups one of the biggest hurdles is money. The cost of software cannot be justified. Thus attraction towards open source. Microsoft has taken care of this problem by launching a program called <a href="http://www.microsoftstartupzone.com/BizSpark">BizSpark</a>. You can enroll yourself if you are a startup with less than one million USD in revenue and less than three years old. There is no cost involved other than a $100 program offering fee which is payable when you exit the program.

Signing up for <a href="http://www.microsoftstartupzone.com/BizSpark">BizSpark</a> gives you access to Operating System, SQL Server, SharePoint,  development tools and production licenses. This is what you get with BizSpark:
<ul>
	<li>All the software included in the Microsoft® Visual Studio® Team System Team Suite (VSTS) with MSDN® Premium subscription</li>
	<li>Expression® Studio Version 2</li>
	<li>VSTS Team Foundation Server (standard edition)</li>
	<li>Production use rights to host a “software as a service” solution (developed during participation in the BizSpark Program, on any platform) over the Internet, with regard to products including:
<ul>
	<li>Microsoft Windows Server® (all versions up to and including Enterprise)</li>
	<li>Microsoft SQL Server® (all versions)</li>
	<li>Microsoft Office SharePoint® Portal Server</li>
	<li>Microsoft System Center</li>
	<li>Microsoft BizTalk® Server</li>
	<li>Microsoft Dynamics® CRM (coming soon)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul></ul>
