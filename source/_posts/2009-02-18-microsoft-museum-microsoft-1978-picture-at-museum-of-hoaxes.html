<p><img title="Microsoft 1978" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="154" alt="Microsoft 1978" src="http://www.debugrelease.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/image10.png" width="226" align="left" border="0" /> This famous picture of the main crew at Microsoft Corporation in 1978 is perhaps one of the most famous photos of Microsoft employees of that time. The picture is mostly seen with the slogan “Would you have invested?” This photo also made it to <a href="http://www.museumofhoaxes.com">Museum Of Hoaxes</a> website which lists facts about people in the photo. While the accuracy of the numbers mentioned is questionable as there is no hard fact and information on the time it was calculated is missing, it however makes an interesting read. From <a href="http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/photos/microsoft.html">Museum Of Hoaxes</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><b>Bill Gates:</b> Still with Microsoft as it's chairman and chief software architect. His fortune is somewhere in the range of $50 billion.      <br /><b>Paul Allen:</b> Left Microsoft in 1983 but remains a senior strategy advisor to the company. Worth around $25 billion.      <br /><b>Bob O'Rear:</b> Left Microsoft in 1983. Is now a cattle rancher and is worth around $100 million.      <br /><b>Bob Greenberg:</b> Left Microsoft in 1981 and then helped launch those Cabbage Patch Dolls that were so popular in the 1980s.
