It is clear that when it comes to Web, Microsoft is not the leading player. That batch goes to a startup(when compared to Microsoft) named Google. At times I feel that in the process of introducing new products Microsoft at times forgets about their old products which could be widely in use. For example Hotmail. It looks like Microsoft has totally forgotten about Hotmail which was once their crown jewel.

Why have they slipped? I think because they have stopped paying attention to small things. Here is an example: After reading an email on Hotmail if you wish to delete it then you must scroll all the way up to top to find the delete button. How hard can it be to put a delete button and maybe the entire toolbar at the end of each message? And while logging in why do users have to type in &lt;xyz&gt;@hotmail.com. It isn't like any other domain names can be used.

As a user I am looking for simple ways to achieve my goals. Web based Hotmail isn't just cutting it anymore. It really should not be a surprise if millions of people have moved to GMail. Ray Ozzie in his Internet Services Disruption memo said
<blockquote>But for all our great progress, our efforts have not always led to the degree that perhaps they could have. We should've been leaders with all our web properties in harnessing the potential of AJAX, following our pioneering work in OWA.</blockquote>
My 2 cents to Microsoft is that maybe you have stopped looking for simple solutions. How about getting your users involved in improving Hotmail. Ask them what they want and I am sure you will get valuable feedback. While Microsoft has done a great job in giving users previews of their software through beta and CTP programs, such an effort is lacking in web based products. So if this post is ever read by anyone who has anything to do with Hotmail or other Microsoft web based products, my suggestion is to have conversations with your users. And have a conversation without noise. Announcing a product after product is great but pause and ask your users what they think about those products.
