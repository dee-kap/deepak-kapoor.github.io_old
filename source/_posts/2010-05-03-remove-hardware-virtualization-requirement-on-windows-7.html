Running XP mode on Windows 7 requires Hardware Virtualization to be enabled. You set this through BIOS settings. But what if your machine does not support Hardware Virtualization. Yes such machines do exist and I have one. My SONY Vaio does not allow Hardware Virtualization. Why? Because itâ€™s a SONY.

A good news for me and others who are in same boat is that Microsoft has released a patch which removes this requirement. Seriously, I cannot thank Microsoft enough for this. Good stuff guys, I owe you a beer.
