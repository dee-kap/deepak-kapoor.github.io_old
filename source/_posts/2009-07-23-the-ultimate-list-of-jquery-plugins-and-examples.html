As a web developer it is hard to ignore the popularity of JQuery. The issue however is that there are too many JQuery plugins available and at times it is hard to decide which one to chose. <a href="http://jquerylist.com/">The Ultimate JQuery List</a> is a fantastic web site which lists hundreds of JQuery plugins with examples.

This will serve as a great reference point if you are looking for JQuery examples.
