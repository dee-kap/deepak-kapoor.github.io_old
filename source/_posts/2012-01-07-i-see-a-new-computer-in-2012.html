<p>There was a time when I was proud of my IT setup at home. All those desktops and laptops sharing bits-n-bytes with each other and participating in networking bliss made me proud. Year 2011 was somehow not too good to my computers. First catastrophe was the denise of my Sony VIAO laptop. This was the machine which build <a href="http://www.everydaymobile.com.au">EverydayMobile.com.au</a>. And I loved it. Next went the Netbook I got for attending <a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/teched-2009-photo-gallery-339298422.htm">TechEd 2009</a>. Biggest disaster was a lightning strike which took away my power horse, my desktop which could put all other machines to shame. I still remember the day when this one went down and with it went the pride I had in my home network. This was also a machine which I assembled as I did all other desktops I've had. There was a special attachment.</p>
<p>The status now is that I have one laptop which is a Mac Book Pro. In all fairness this has been my main work machine for past 1.5 years. I am also using it as my main machine connected to a Dell 24" monitor. Other than that there is a Windows machine connected to main TV set running <a href="http://xbmc.org/">XBMC</a>. BTW: XMBC is the best media centre software out there. You must look at it.</p>
<p>Someone and I don't know who said that "May the dreams of your past be the reality of your future". With that in my mind I look forward to 2012 which shall be the year of revival for my home computing. But this time I am about to do things differently. After being influenced by Apple over last year and a half, I have decided to do without a desktop PC. So at some point in 2012 I plan to get a iMac. The model I am considering is the 27". iMac is one of those machine which triggers love at first sight.</p>

<p>The configuration I have in mind is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>27-inch screen</li>

  <li>Intel Core i7 3.4GHz quad-core</li>

  <li>16GB RAM because I alway run Windows in VM</li>
</ul>
<p>iMac has the ability to hook up another monitor so I will also use my Dell 24-inch monitor as a secondary screen. This will be the main work horse at home.</p>
<p>In terms of portable computing I am thinking another iPad. The one I have now has been permanently hijacked by boss at home. And my Mac Book Pro which serves well both for Windows and Mac development.</p>
<p>The question now is of funding. I have a plan up my sleeves which shall be revealed if it works.</p>
<p>Till then dreaming and thinking about my iMac...</p>
