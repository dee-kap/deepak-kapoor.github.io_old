Yesterday <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7604293.stm">Large Hardon Collider</a> went RTM at CERN. The Collider will provide insightful information about moments after Big Bang. Now for most of us Big Bang is just a very very big bang and starting of everything including space and time. But if you are not willing to settle at that and if you are interested in learning more about the Collider and Big Bang then satch this rap video. All I can say about the video is that Snoop Dogg has got nothing to worry about.
