I had a look at <a href="http://www.linqpad.net/">LINQPad</a> few months ago when I wrote about how you can use this tool to <a href="http://www.debugrelease.com/view-t-sql-query-generated-by-linq-to-sql-using-linqpad/">view generated LINQ To SQL Queries</a>. There is not doubt that LINQPad comes in as a very handy tool when writing LINQ queries. But writing queries in LINQPad has not been that easy. Until Now!

LINQPad now has <strong>Intellisense</strong>. <a href="http://www.albahari.com/">Joseph Albahari</a> has released this much desired feature. He is running a $17 for single license deal till December 23rd. At 17 bucks you can't go wrong. The time it will save you justifies the price many times.

If you are new to LINQ and need some guidance then LINQPad also comes with aÂ  collection of sample queries to get you started.

I bought my auto-completion code today and I've been playing with LINQPad like a kid with a new toy. Thanks Joseph for putting together this nice tool.
