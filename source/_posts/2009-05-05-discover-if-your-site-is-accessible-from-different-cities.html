<p>If you run a website then you assume the comfort that people from all over the world can browse your site. This may not be completely true. For example your site could be blocked or just not accessible from certain cities in the world. Just Ping is a service you can use to find out if your site is indeed accessible from different cities. The way it works is that it pings your site from 37 different checkpoints in the world. </p>  <p>I ran it for my site and found that One .Net Way is not accessible from China. Was it something I posted? I need to get to the bottom of this. </p>  <p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.debugrelease.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/image8.png" width="540" height="511" /> </p>  <p>Access Just Ping <strike><a href="http://www.just-ping.com">here</a></strike>.</p>
