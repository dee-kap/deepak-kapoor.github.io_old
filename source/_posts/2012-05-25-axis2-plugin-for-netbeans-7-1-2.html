<p>I upgraded Netbeans today and found that there is no Axis2 plugin available via Tools –&gt; Plugins. Looks like Axis2 support plugin has been discontinued in Netbeans. However the link below works and I was able to install the plugin. This post hopefully will serve as a bookmark when I’m looking for Axis2 plugin in Netbeans next time.</p> <p><a title="http://deadlock.netbeans.org/hudson/job/nbms-and-javadoc/lastStableBuild/artifact/nbbuild/nbms/updates.xml.gz" href="http://deadlock.netbeans.org/hudson/job/nbms-and-javadoc/lastStableBuild/artifact/nbbuild/nbms/updates.xml.gz">http://deadlock.netbeans.org/hudson/job/nbms-and-javadoc/lastStableBuild/artifact/nbbuild/nbms/updates.xml.gz</a></p>
