<p>It feels good when you find a hidden gem on www. Through a link trail which I cannot remember now I somehow landed up on <a href="http://sqlserver2008jumpstart.microsofttraining.com/">SQL Server 2008 Jumpstart site</a>. Here you can access training material which is categorised into four tracks.</p>  <ol>   <li>Database Infrastructure Track</li>    <li>Business Intelligence Track</li>    <li>Developer Track</li>    <li>Application Compatibility &amp; Upgrade Track,</li> </ol>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Each of the tracks have reading material, demos and Hands on Labs. I think this is great source to get skilled up on SQL Server 2008 from the comfort of your home / office.</p> Here is the link to <a href="http://sqlserver2008jumpstart.microsofttraining.com/">SQL Jumpstart site</a>.
