I have been thinking about splitting my blogging adventures between <a href="http://www.deepakkapoor.net/">personal</a> and <a href="http://www.debugrelease.com/">technical</a> for some time. Due to legitimate reasons such as procrastination I have held back. Finally the day has come when the sun is shining, birds are chirping and most importantly domain of choice is available. Hence a journey starts.

I am planning to put in similar effort and provide valuable content for all .NET developers as I did with my old blog. Other than just code oriented posts I will try to write tips-n-tricks, news, information about products, books and everything that is touched by .NET.

I will also use this blog to conduct an ever going experiment in which I will study the ins and outs of building a community using a blog. Now such a thing has been done many times before. I know many people who have built great communities through blogs. So this is not about re-re-inventing the wheel. This is a learning exercise to observe and participate in the process of creating something.  In any experiment it is fundamental to produce, analyse and report data. Thus I will endeavour to publish a monthly progress report about this site.

This blog runs on <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a>. Now you may ask; why WordPress and why not a .NET based solution? The simple answer is because presently WordPress is the best blogging platform on the planet.  I would love to host it using a .NET/ASP.NET based solution but there isn’t much out there to match the might of WordPress when it comes to blogging. So essentially it is picking the best solution. I adapt the same approach in my consultancy engagements where I study the requirements carefully and recommend the best solution. One DotNet Way uses a free theme provided by <a href="http://www.uniqueblogdesigns.com">Unique Blog Designs</a>. Sometime in future I may move to a customised theme. But that is for later.

I hope you will enjoy your visit here and I hope to see you again.

Till my next post...
