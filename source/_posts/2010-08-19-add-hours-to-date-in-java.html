<p>I’ll come out clean on this. Lately I’ve been doing some Java and I have to say that the other side is not all that bad as it’s projected to be. Most of my Java work is around integration with .NET&#160; and I’m lovin it.</p>  <p>My forays into Java and other non-Microsoft technologies is a post for another day. Today I just want to share some simple code which I wrote while I was struggling with a simple requirement. The requirement is to add x number of hours to current Date-Time.</p>  <p>I found that the best way to do this is by using <strong>Calendar</strong> class from <strong>java.utils</strong> package. Here is the code I wrote.</p>  <pre class="brush: java;">public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Create a new calendar object
        Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();

        System.out.println(calendar);

        // Add 5 hours to current time
        calendar.add(Calendar.HOUR, 5);

        System.out.println(calendar);

    }</pre>

<p>Each day as I work with Java I find things that seem interesting especially for a .NET guy. I’ll keep posting them.</p>
