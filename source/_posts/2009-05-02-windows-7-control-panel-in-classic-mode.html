<p>What is the first thing you do when you open the control panel in Windows Vista? I always switch it to Classic View and most people I know do the same. Microsoft got it so right with the Classic View and I cannot understand whey they are trying to convince people to move away from it. This is what Classic View looks like in Vista.</p>  <p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="Windows7" border="0" alt="Windows7" src="http://www.debugrelease.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/image.png" width="540" height="329" /> </p>  <p>So what did I do when I opened the Control Panel in Windows 7? Yup! I wanted to switch it to the Classic Mode. The way I achieved my objective is a little different than how it is done in Vista. In Windows 7 you have to click on the View by drop-down and choose large icons of small icons depending on your preference. And Iâ€™m back to my Classic Mode for the Control Panel. And life is once again good :)</p>  <p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="Windows7" border="0" alt="Windows7" src="http://www.debugrelease.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/image1.png" width="450" height="384" /></p>
