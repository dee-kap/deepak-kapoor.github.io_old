The error would occur when I created a new folder on the card. Initially I suspected this to be a virus but I also wanted to explore other options. And I discovered the solution pretty much by accident.
<h5>Solution</h5>
I had many files in the root of SD Card. <strong>Moving files from root to another folder fixed the error</strong> and I can now create new folders and copy new files.

So if you have too many files in the root and cannot create new folders or copy new files then check if you have a little too many files in the root. If yes, then move these files to another folder on your SD card.
