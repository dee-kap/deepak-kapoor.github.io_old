I have encountered an issue with Word 2007 many times. The issue is that when I open a document, I cannot click anywhere within the document. I can however click on the ribbon, status bar and the chrome but somehow not on the document. I also cannot select anything in my document.

The solution to fix this issue is <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;940791">documented</a> at Microsoft Help and Support.

I am somehow confident that I will get this issue again. And this post will save my time searching for the solution.
