<p>When I visit google.com in Internet Explorer, Google is able to detect my homepage. I thought this was not possible but seems like it is as google is doing it. It turns out that there is a <strong>isHomePage</strong> method which only works on Internet Explorer and it can be used to find a userâ€™s home page. </p>  <p><a href="http://samples.msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/samples/author/behaviors/homepage1.htm">This link</a> explains it all. </p>
