Before a certification exam goes live it is released as beta. Beta exams are by invite only and there are limited number of places. These exams also run for a short period of time. Till now finding about beta exams has been a bit of a trick. Your best bets are forums or various blogs. However this is changing. There is a new blog called <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/betaexams/">Beta Exam Announcements</a> where you can find out about upcoming beta exams.

If you are interested in finding about beta exams then subscribe to the <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/betaexams/rss.xml">feed</a> of <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/betaexams/">Beta Exam Announcements</a>.
