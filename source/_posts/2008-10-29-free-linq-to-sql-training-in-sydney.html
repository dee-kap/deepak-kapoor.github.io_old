I am running a LINQ To SQL Training day on Saturday November 8th at Microsoft Office in North Ryde. The course is <strong>FREE</strong> for anyone to attend but there are <strong>only 20 places</strong> available. So if have not yet jumped into the wonderful world of writing LINQ queries. If you are considering LINQ To SQL for your project. If you think that you need a head start on LINQ To SQL. Then attend this one day course and give yourself a LINQ To SQL confidence boost.

You can register for this course by contacting <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/acoat/archive/2008/10/29/free-linq-to-sql-training-in-sydney-nov-8th.aspx">Andrew Coates</a> through this <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/acoat/contact.aspx">link</a>.

There will be computers available in the training room. You are also welcome to bring your own laptops and that way you can take the code you write during training with you. If you plan to bring your own laptop then make sure that you have Visual Studio 2008 and SQL Server 2005/2008 installed.
