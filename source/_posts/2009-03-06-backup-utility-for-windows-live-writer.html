<p>Windows Live Writer which IMO is the best software for blog posting has been missing a desirable feature. i.e. to backup posts, pages, settings etc. Today I found about Windows Live Writer Backup application on CodePlex. This little application will backup your posts and blog settings. The application is a RC at this stage.</p>  <p><img title="image" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="348" alt="image" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B6PDO8HPEQZNZWpTRms0ZWtlaUU/uploads/2009/03/image1.png" width="481" border="0" /> </p>  <p>Given the popularity of Windows Live Writer, I see a good uptake for this application. </p>  <p>You can download Windows Live Writer Backup <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/WLWBackup">here</a>.</p>
