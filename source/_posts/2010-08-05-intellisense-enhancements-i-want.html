<p>Back in 2008 I posted a suggestion on Microsoft’s Connect website. To be precise the date was 15th May 2008. To my surprise I received an email today (5th August 2010) informing me that there is a comment on my suggestion. It only took a little more than 2 years. Wow! talk about a speedy response. “What’s wrong with Microsoft” will be a topic for another post. Today I want to revisit my suggestion. It’s about Intellisense. Here it is exactly how I posted it on Connect site.</p>  <p><strong>Problem Statement</strong></p>  <p>At present we have Ctrl + . which opens intellisense and lists all methods, properties events available for the corresponding object. There are times when I and I assume other users are only interested in looking at either events, methods or properties. </p>  <p><strong>Proposed Solution</strong></p>  <p>I suggest the following shortcuts which will filter the list:    <br />Ctrl + . + p - Display only properties     <br />Ctrl + . + e - Display only events     <br />Ctrl + . + m - Display only methods </p>  <p>And the response from Microsoft today is:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Thanks for taking the time to submit this suggestion! I sincerely apologize for the amount of time that has taken to get back to you.      <br />When we locked down on our final feature set for the next version of Visual Studio, IntelliSense completion set filtering for member types didn't make the cut--though it was considered. However, his is a commonly requested feature, and we'll consider it for a future release of Visual Studio. Please feel free to contact me directly at … if you have any further thoughts.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I am glad to know that this will at-least be considered for a future release. I’ll be happy if it ever gets implemented. </p>
