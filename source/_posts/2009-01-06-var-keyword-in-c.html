<p>I have a confession to make. When I saw <strong>var</strong> keyword for the first time I did not like it at all. My first opinion was that var was so variant like. Call me a control freak but I like to clearly see what I am declaring. And var was something I thought made the code less readable. However since I started working with LINQ I got into a habit of using var. I realised that it makes my life easy by letting the compiler figure things out for me. So in this post I will pay due respect to var keyword. </p>  <p>Anything declared using var keyword is implicitly typed which means that compiler will determine the correct type based on what the variable is initialised to. Here I am declaring three variables x, y and z. All of them are initialised to different values which are also of different Types such as DateTime, string and List&lt;T&gt;.</p>  

<pre class="lang:c# decode:true " >
var x = DateTime.Now;
var y = "Hello";
var z = new List<String>();
</pre>


<p>Let's examine the IL to verify that x, y and z are of Types they have been initialised to.</p>

<p>Here you can see that x is of valuetype, y is a string and z is of type List&lt;string&gt;.</p>

<p>I find this as neat little syntax sugar to which I have become addicted.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that you cannot write a statement like this. </p>

<pre class="lang:c# decode:true " >
var x;
</pre>


<p>This will give an error while compiling. And it makes sense because the compiler does not know which Type it should consider x as.</p>
