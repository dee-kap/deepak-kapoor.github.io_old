<p>Best thing about running One .Net Way is interaction with members of developer community. I thoroughly enjoy answering questions which come my way through this site. Early in the morning today I saw a question by <a href="http://www.joeyesq.com/">Joey</a>. To avoid loosing details in paraphrasing, here is the exact question asked by Joey.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>I’m new to LINQ. If I had two tables “Customer” and “CustomerDetails”, how (using LINQ) can I insert to both of these tables? Do I need to create a “Customer” object as well as a “CustomerDetails” object?</p> </blockquote>  <p>In short the answer is yes. LINQ can insert to both tables, you will need to populate both Customer and CustomerDetails objects with data. I will now present an example to support my answer. </p>  <p>What we have here is a one to many scenario which involves two tables linked through a Foreign Key. To serve as an example, I have modelled the tables like this.</p>  <p><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.debugrelease.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/image12.png" width="359" height="379" /> </p>  <p>Each customer can have many nick names which are stored in CustomerDetails table. Let’s go ahead and generate LINQ To SQL entities. Please refer to <a href="http://www.debugrelease.com/linq-to-sql-tutorial/">LINQ To SQL tutorial</a> if you want a refresher on how to generate LINQ To SQL entities. After dragging our tables to designer we can see that designer has recognised relationship we have between our tables.</p>  <p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.debugrelease.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/image13.png" width="497" height="168" /> </p>  <p>A quick glance over generated code confirms that we have a property of Type EntitySet&lt;CustomerDetails&gt; in our Customer class.</p>  <p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.debugrelease.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/image14.png" width="394" height="216" /> </p>  <p>Now let’s insert some data. The following code will insert one Customer record and two CustomerDetails records.</p>  

 
<pre class="lang:c# decode:true " >private void InsertData()
{
  string firstName = "LINQ";
  string lastName = "Dude";
  string nickName1 = "Cool";
  string nickName2 = "DataBuster";

  using (CustomerDatabaseDataContext context = new CustomerDatabaseDataContext())
  {
    // Create a Customer object
    Customer customer = new Customer
      {
        FirstName = firstName,
        LastName = lastName,
        // Create two CustomerDetails objects
        CustomerDetails = new System.Data.Linq.EntitySet&lt;CustomerDetail&gt;() 
          {
            new CustomerDetail{NickName = nickName1},
            new CustomerDetail{NickName = nickName2}
          }

        };

    // We'd like to Insert our changes as new 
    context.Customers.InsertOnSubmit(customer);
    // Submit changes to database
    context.SubmitChanges();
  }
}</pre> 


<p>Code above produces following T-SQL</p>

 
<pre class="lang:tsql decode:true " >exec sp_executesql N'INSERT INTO [dbo].[Customer]([FirstName], [LastName])
VALUES (@p0, @p1)

SELECT CONVERT(Int,SCOPE_IDENTITY()) AS [value]',N'@p0 varchar(4),@p1 varchar(4)',
@p0='LINQ',@p1='Dude'
go
exec sp_executesql N'INSERT INTO [dbo].[CustomerDetails]([CustomerId], [NickName])
VALUES (@p0, @p1)

SELECT CONVERT(Int,SCOPE_IDENTITY()) AS [value]',N'@p0 int,@p1 varchar(4)',
@p0=2,@p1='Cool'
go
exec sp_executesql N'INSERT INTO [dbo].[CustomerDetails]([CustomerId], [NickName])
VALUES (@p0, @p1)

SELECT CONVERT(Int,SCOPE_IDENTITY()) AS [value]',N'@p0 int,@p1 varchar(10)',
@p0=2,@p1='DataBuster'
go</pre> 


<p>In T-SQL above you can see that we are inserting one row for Customer and two rows for CustomerDetails. However in our C# we only called SubmitChanges once. </p>
