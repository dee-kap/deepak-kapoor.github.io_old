Since MSDN forums started they have captured substantial share of online forums related to Microsoft technologies. I remember having a discussion with one of the softies about newsgroups and how MSDN forums will eventually replace them (in MS world of course). And now you can interact with Microsoft forums using a client application which is available as a CTP <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/msdnforumsclient">here</a>.

To install Microsoft forums you must have <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=b5a78784-922d-4267-a6e9-5d2ecf1dced8&amp;displaylang=en">WindowsLiveID Client SDK</a> installed on your machine.
