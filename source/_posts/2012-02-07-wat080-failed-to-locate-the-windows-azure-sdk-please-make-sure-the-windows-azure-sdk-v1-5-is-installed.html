<p>After installing Windows Azure SDK and Visual Studio tools November 2011, I got this error when compiling an existing Cloud project.</p>  <p><font color="#c0504d">WAT080: Failed to locate the Windows Azure SDK. Please make sure the Windows Azure SDK v1.5 is installed.</font></p>  <p>This post documents the roller coaster ride I went through to solve the problem. If you are interested in just the solution then here it is:</p>  <p><font color="#008080">Download the bits from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=28045">this page</a> and install them manually.</font> </p>  <p>If you are interested in how I got to the solution then read on. </p>  <p>Before anything, let me clarify that I already had an older version of Azure SDK and tools on my machine. I used Web Platform installer to install the latest Azure SDK and Visual Studio Tools i.e. November update. Then a drama started. </p>  <p>The build error I got said that I should make sure that Windows Azure SDK v1.5 is installed. But I already installed v1.6. If the project files were changed between versions of tools then they should have been upgraded to latest version by Visual Studio. This did not happen. My first maneuver was to re-install Visual Studio tools. I downloaded just the standalone installer for tools and tried installing it. I got this error.</p>  <p>&#160;<img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.debugrelease.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/image.png" width="485" height="300" /></p>  <p>The log file showed me these errors:</p> <font color="#0000ff" size="1">[16AC:16B0][2012-02-07T07:21:21]: Error 0x80070643: Failed to install MSI package.    <br />[16AC:16B0][2012-02-07T07:21:21]: Error 0x80070643: Failed to execute MSI package.     <br />[1744:1748][2012-02-07T07:21:21]: Error 0x80070643: Failed to configure per-machine MSI package.     <br />[1744:1748][2012-02-07T07:21:21]: Error 0x80070643: Failed to execute MSI package.</font>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>I was in no mood for looking into the details of errors in the log file. I just wanted to get going with Azure and not worry about installer logs. So I uninstalled the SDK, Authoring Tools and Visual Studio tools to get a clean Azure free environment.</p>  <p><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.debugrelease.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/image1.png" width="321" height="51" /></p>  <p>After uninstalling Azure bits I fired up Web Platform Installer and installed Azure SDK and tools. Little did I know that this was not going to work. Here is a screenshot of the errors I got.</p>  <p><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.debugrelease.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/image2.png" width="622" height="414" /></p>  <p>By this time I was annoyed (you may substitute “annoyed” with a more colorful word of your choice). Web Platform Installer should just do it, right? It should take care of dependencies, right? Well that was not the case.</p>  <p>By this time I gave up on Web Platform Installer and downloaded standalone Azure bits and decided to install them manually. Here is the download link:</p>  <p><a title="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=28045" href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=28045">http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=28045</a></p>  <p>I downloaded and installed the ones highlighted below.</p>  <p><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.debugrelease.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/image3.png" width="641" height="458" /></p>  <p>After installing Azure Emulator, Libs and SDK, I installed Visual Studio Tools and it installed correctly.</p>  <p><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.debugrelease.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/image4.png" width="485" height="300" /></p>  <p>I opened the project which was giving me a build error. Visual Studio asked me to convert it to a newer format. I happily obliged. Finally I saw <font color="#00c100"><strong>Build Succeeded</strong></font>.</p>  <p>Although not a big deal specially after the issue was resolved, I still feel that installer could have done a better job. Anyhow, I’m back in the cloud <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="http://www.debugrelease.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/wlEmoticon-smile.png" /></p>
