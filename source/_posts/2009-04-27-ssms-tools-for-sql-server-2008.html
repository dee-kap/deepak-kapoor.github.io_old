<p>SSMS Tools Pack is a must have add-in for SQL Server Management Studio. It comes packed with a great set of features which as the author says on his site “…were missing from Management Studio”. Here is run down of three features I use most. </p>  <h3>Text Format</h3>  <p>If SSMS Tools Pack had only one feature and it was text formatting I’d still have praise for the tool. In the past I have used tricks such as switching to query designer view or an online SQL formatting service to format my SQL. With SSMS Tools Pack this can easily be done by pressing Ctrl+K and Ctrl+G. This feature is also configurable and you can enable/ disable keywords.</p>  <p><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="SSMS Tools Pack" border="0" alt="SSMS Tools Pack" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B6PDO8HPEQZNZWpTRms0ZWtlaUU/uploads/2009/04/image4.png" width="540" height="465" /> </p>  <h3>Generate Insert Statements</h3>  <p>Insert Statements can be easily generated for data in your tables. This comes in handy when you want to script your data and maybe run it on another database. Generating Insert Statements is easily done by right clicking on the table –&gt; SSMS Tools –&gt; Generate Insert Statements.</p>  <p><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="SSMS Tools Pack" border="0" alt="SSMS Tools Pack" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B6PDO8HPEQZNZWpTRms0ZWtlaUU/uploads/2009/04/image5.png" width="188" height="426" /> </p>  <h3>SQL Query Execution History</h3>  <p>While working with databases I can at times write a lot of queries. I usually end up commenting many in Query editor just to keep them around. With SQL Query Execution History I don’t bother. I always get a nice history of all queries I have executed in the order of execution.</p>  <p><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="SSMS Tools Pack" border="0" alt="SSMS Tools Pack" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B6PDO8HPEQZNZWpTRms0ZWtlaUU/uploads/2009/04/image6.png" width="540" height="173" /> </p>  <p>Other than its features, the thing I like most about SSMS Tools Pack is that it is a light weight add-in which does not mess up your environment. So if you spend a lot or any time writing SQL then SSMS Tools Pack is worth a look.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.ssmstoolspack.com/">Link to Download SSMS Tools Pack.</a></p>
