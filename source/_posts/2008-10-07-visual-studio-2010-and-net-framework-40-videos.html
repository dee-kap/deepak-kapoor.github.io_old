An exciting news in last few days has been announcements of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2008/09/29/what-s-next-for-visual-studio-and-net-fx.aspx">Visual Studio 2010 and .NET Framework 4.0</a>. The actual products may be more than a year away. To get the ball rolling, Microsoft has posted many videos on Channel9 which give you a sneak peak into some features. Can't wait to get my hands on the latest CTP which I guess will be available at or around PCD.

Here are two of my favourites from many others.
